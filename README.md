Expo Snack is an open-source platform for running React Native apps in the browser. It dynamically bundles and compiles code and runs it in the Expo Client or in a web-player. Code can be saved as "Snacks" and easily shared with others. Snacks can also be embedded to show "live" previews as used by the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
